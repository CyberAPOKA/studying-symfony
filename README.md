# studying-symfony
## This website is a personal blog and was made using the symfony framework to put my already developed projects with instructions on how to use them.
VocÃª pode baixar o projeto ou usar o comando ``` git clone https://github.com/CyberAPOKA/studying-symfony.git ```, then open the project in your editor and type the following commands in the terminal,  ``` composer install ``` and then ``` symfony serve ```, the project is already running in local environment ``` 127.0.0.1:8000 ```.
